 The pattern I see in the doublerAppend
 method is that it gradually increases 
 based on how big the array is. 
 The doublerInsert exponentially gets 
 way larger faster, even though it 
 started off as the more efficient 
 method, if the array is large it is 
 very slow in comparison with the 
 doublerAppend method.
